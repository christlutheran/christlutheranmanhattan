# Divine Service

**In the Divine Service, God comes to us with His gifts of forgiveness, life, and salvation**. We receive these gifts, then we give Him thanksgiving and praise. Please join us to receive these gifts and give God praise and thanksgiving on Sundays at 10:30 AM.

## Overview

**The Divine Service should be Christ–centered and not man–centered.** It should focus on the forgiveness of sins and not on what the people want. It should be a "heaven on earth" and not like the local pop concert. It should be holy and not casual. It should be centered on building faith in Christ and not on building up the emotions. It should be a common form and language for everyone (old and young, rich and poor, parents, and children) and not cater to one particular generation. 

**Worship and faith go together.** As we worship, so we believe; and as we believe, so we worship. If you want to understand what we believe, then join us in worship. 

**The liturgy serves to provide the structure through which forgiveness, life, and salvation are delivered to us.** It provides the form and shape of the service. Just because a self–chosen form of worship may appeal to a person's feelings; it should not be used. When a homemade order of service seeks to be "relevant", it runs the risk of turning attention away from God and onto us.

**The hymnal is one of the most important books in teaching the Christian faith.** It should always remain faithful to the Word of God. Hymns are simply doctrine put into poetic form. The hymns in our hymnal draw from both the rich Lutheran tradition and a diverse heritage of faithful Christian sources spanning ancient, medieval, and contemporary times.

In the Divine Service, God gives us the Gospel from the baptismal font, the pulpit, and the altar. We receive these gifts of salvation, then we give Him thanksgiving in word and in song.

## What to Expect

When you visit for the Divine Service, you'll experience:

- Jesus as the center in both our preaching and teaching
- The forgiveness of sins is at the heart of the Divine Service
- The Lord's Supper is served every Sunday
- Traditional Liturgy from the Lutheran Service Book
- Congregational singing of Lutheran hymns
- Historic vestments

### For First Time Visitors

- Take a bulletin (available in the narthex / entryway)
- Feel free to sit anywhere, please fill out the attendence book available in each row after being seated
- Grab a Lutheran Service Book (on the back of the pews) that we will follow during the Divine Service
- The service typically lasts a little over an hour
- We practice closed communion ***see note below***
- Our Pastor will greet everyone as they leave

**Regarding Holy Communion**: Closed communion is an ancient practice dating back to the Apostles' themselves. Those who do not properly confess what Scripture teaches regarding Christ and His Supper must not be given the Sacrament (1 Cor 10:17 | 1 Cor 11:27 | 1 Cor 11:29). Those who are members of the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod are invited to the Lord's Supper. We invite others to learn about the Gospel and Sacrament in a new member class before taking communion.

## The Liturgy

We follow the Lutheran Service Book (LSB) during the Liturgy along with the printed bulletin for that day that will guide us through the Divine Service. Normally, we use Divine Service Setting Three beginning on page 184.

> We do not abolish the Mass, but religiously maintain and defend it. For among us masses are celebrated every Lord's Day and on the other festivals, in which the Sacrament is offered to those who wish to use it, after they have been examined and absolved. And the usual public ceremonies are observed, the series of lessons, of prayers, vestments, and other like things
> <cite>Apology to the Augsburg Confession, Article XXIV.1, "The Mass"</cite> 

### Preparation

#### Invocation - Confession and Absolution
The service begins with confession of sins and the pronouncement of absolution. Scripture teaches:

> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
> <cite>1 John 1:9</cite>

### Service of the Word

#### Introit
A Psalm that introduces the theme of the day.

#### Kyrie
The congregation cries "Lord, have mercy" (Greek: Kyrie eleison), echoing the blind man's plea:

> Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
> <cite>Luke 18:38</cite>

#### Gloria in Excelsis
The song of the angels at Christ's birth:

> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased!
> <cite>Luke 2:14</cite>

#### Salutation and Collect of the Day
Greeting of "The Lord be with you" from the Pastor and the congregation responding with "And with thy spirit". The collect (short prayer) of the day follows after this.

#### The Readings
Christ Lutheran Church uses the <a href="https://lectionary.christlutheranmanhattan.org" target="_blank">historic One-Year Lectionary</a> for readings throughout the Church Year. Each Sunday will include the following readings:

- Old Testament
- Epistle (or New Testament)
- Holy Gospel

As our Lord promises:

> The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
> <cite>John 6:63</cite>

#### Creed
We confess the Nicene Creed, as the Formula of Concord states:

> And because directly after the times of the apostles, and even while they were still living, false teachers and heretics arose, and symbols, i. e., brief, succinct confessions, were composed against them in the early Church, which were regarded as the unanimous, universal Christian faith and confession of the orthodox and true Church, namely, the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed, we pledge ourselves to them, and hereby reject all heresies and dogmas which, contrary to them, have been introduced into the Church of God.
> <cite>Formula of Concord, Epitome</cite>

#### Sermon
The proclamation of Law and Gospel, as St. Paul writes:

> Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
> <cite>2 Timothy 4:2</cite>

#### Offertory
After hearing the sermon, the congregation responds with Ps 51:10-12

#### Offering
As an expression of worship and thanksgiving, the congregation responds to God's blessing in their lives and offers back a portion of what He has entrusted to them. The offering is used to provide for the continuation of the church's pastoral ministry. (1 Cor 16:2 | 2 Cor 9:5-7 | Gal 6:6-7)

#### Prayer of the Church
Petitions are brought before God with the Pastor ending each petition with "Lord in your mercy" followed by the congregation responding with "hear our prayer" (1 Tim 2:1-2)

### Service of the Sacrament

#### Preface and Sanctus
The congregation joins in the song of the seraphim:

> Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!
> <cite>Isaiah 6:3</cite>

#### The Lord's Prayer
As Christ taught us to pray (Matt 6:9-13)

#### The Words of Our Lord (Institution) - Pax Domini - Agnus Dei
Christ's own words establish His real presence:

> This is My body... This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
> <cite>Matt 26:26, Matt 26:28</cite>

#### Distribution
Luther explains in the Large Catechism:

> We must never regard the Sacrament as a harmful thing from which we should flee, but as a pure, wholesome, soothing medicine which aids and quickens us in both soul and body. For where the soul is healed, the body has benefited also. Here in the Sacrament you receive from Christ's lips the forgiveness of sins, protection, defense, and power against death and the devil and all evils.
> <cite>Luther's Large Catechism, Part V – The Sacrament of the Altar, paragraphs 68 & 70</cite>

#### Nunc Dimittis - Thankgsiving - Post-Communion Collect
Giving thanks for the gifts received.

#### Salutation - Benedicamus - Benediction
The service concludes with the Aaronic blessing:

> The Lord bless you and keep you; the lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.
> <cite>Numbers 6:24-26</cite>
