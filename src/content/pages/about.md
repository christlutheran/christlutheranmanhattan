### What to Expect

When you visit Christ Lutheran Church, you'll experience:

For first time visitors to the Divine Service, here are some important things to know:

- Take a bulletin (available in the narthex / entryway)
- Feel free to sit anywhere, please fill out the red attendence book available in each row after being seated
- Grab a Lutheran Service Book (under the chairs) that we will follow during the Divine Service
- The service typically lasts a little over an hour
- We practice closed communion ***see note below***
- Our Pastor will greet everyone as they leave

**Regarding Holy Communion**: Closed communion is an ancient practice dating back to the Apostles' themselves. Those who do not properly confess what Scripture teaches regarding Christ and His Supper must not be given the Sacrament (1 Cor 10:17| 1 Cor 11:27 | 1 Cor 11:29). Those who are members of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod are invited to the Lord's Supper. We invite others to learn about the Gospel and Sacrament in a new member class before taking communion.
