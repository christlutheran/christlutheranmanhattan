**Regarding Holy Communion**: Closed communion is an ancient practice dating back to the Apostles' themselves. Those who do not properly confess what Scripture teaches regarding Christ and His Supper must not be given the Sacrament (1 Cor 10:17 | 1 Cor 11:27 | 1 Cor 11:29). Those who are members of the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod are invited to the Lord's Supper. We invite others to learn about the Gospel and Sacrament in a new member class before taking communion.
