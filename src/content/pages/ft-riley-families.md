## Christ Lutheran for Ft. Riley Soldiers & Families

Life in the military brings frequent moves, new communities, and unique challenges.  
At Christ Lutheran Church, we are honored to serve the soldiers, spouses, and families of Ft. Riley.  
Here you will find a stable and faithful spiritual home, rooted in Christ and His promises.
